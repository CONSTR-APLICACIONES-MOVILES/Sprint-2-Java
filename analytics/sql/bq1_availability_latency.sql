/*BQ1 (Type 1, App Telemetry)"
  What is the average response time of the availability engine when calculating common time
    slots for groups of different sizes?
    Source event: availability_calc, logged by AvailabilityEngine.findCommonSlotsAsync().
    Schedule: daily scheduled query, destination table parchapp_analytics.bq1_availability_latency,
    shown in the team Looker Studio dashboard.
    Replace `parchapp.analytics_PROPERTY_ID` with the Firebase Analytics export dataset. */
