  /*BQ3 (Type 2, Direct User Experience Improvement)
    What percentage of the time slots suggested by the recommendation engine are accepted by the
    organizer without being changed?

      Source event: slot_accepted, logged by CreateActivitySheet when an activity is created from a
      slot chosen in Compare Availability. slot_position is the slot's place in the ranked list
      (0 = best match); modified = 1 when the organiser changed the time or the group before creating.
      
      Feedback loop: the row with is_recommended = TRUE gives the value that must be copied to the
      Firestore document insights/bq3_slot_acceptance, field recommended_position (a number). The app
      reads it in FirestoreInsightsRepository and marks that slot as Recommended (feature F2).

      Replace `parchapp.analytics_PROPERTY_ID` with the Firebase Analytics export dataset. When back is done */
