  /*BQ8 (Type 3, Feature Analysis)
    Which core coordination functionalities are used least frequently during the process of organizing an activity?

      Source event: feature_used (params: feature, screen), logged through
      AnalyticsTracker.trackFeature(). Features: groups, compare_availability, schedule, invitations, alerts.
      
      Schedule: daily scheduled query, destination table parchapp_analytics.bq8_feature_usage, shown in the team Looker Studio dashboard. Least used features come first.
      Replace `parchapp.analytics_PROPERTY_ID` with the Firebase Analytics export dataset. */
